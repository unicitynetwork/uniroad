## Summary
Built a complete browser-based implementation of the Uniroad P2P marketplace that includes:
- HTML layout with marketplace, inventory, and user interfaces
- CSS styling for clean visual presentation
- JavaScript client implementation with all marketplace functionality
- Webpack bundling for browser compatibility

## Request Details
The user needed a web GUI for their P2P marketplace based on Unicity blockchain platform, converting from a CLI-based implementation to a browser UI according to a design sketch. The implementation needed to maintain compatibility with their existing Y.js-based synchronization and UniroadDB marketplace logic.

## Implementation Details
Created:
- index.html - Main UI interface with marketplace, inventory, and connection panels
- styles.css - Complete styling for responsive interface
- browser-client.js - Client implementation adapting node-client.js functionality
- webpack.config.js - Configuration for bundling with browser compatibility
- Updated package.json with build scripts and dependencies

Main features:
- Real-time marketplace updates
- Inventory management
- Item listing and purchasing
- Coin management
- Secure transaction handling

## Build Process
Resolved several cross-platform compatibility issues:
1. Converted ES Module imports to CommonJS for compatibility
2. Added polyfills for Node.js built-in modules in browser
3. Configured webpack for proper bundling of dependencies
4. Bundled all dependencies into a single file for simplicity

## Usage Instructions
1. Open index.html in web browser
2. Connect to WebSocket server with credentials
3. Use the marketplace functionality:
   - View and buy items from the marketplace
   - Add coins to inventory
   - Create and list items for sale
   - Manage inventory

## Technical Notes
The implementation maintains compatibility with:
- Y.js for CRDT-based data synchronization
- WebSocket provider for networking
- UniroadDB for marketplace logic
- Unicity transaction flow engine for token operations
